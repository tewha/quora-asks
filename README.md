Quora has replaced their partnership program (which financially rewarded people for asking stupid questions) with the Quora Prompt Generator (which asks stupid questions without human intervention).

I'm going to collect these with the idea of one day creating a Mastodon robot to post one daily. But for now I just want to collect them.

There's currently a focus on Apple related questions, but that's just what Quora keeps asking me.
