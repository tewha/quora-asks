Quora has replaced their partnership program (which rewarded people for asking stupid questions) which the Quora Prompt Generator (which asks stupid questions without human intervention).

I'm going to collect these with the idea of one day creating a Mastodon robot to post one daily. But for now I just want to collect them.
